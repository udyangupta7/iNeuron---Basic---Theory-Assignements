    "A major purpose of functions is to group code that gets executed multiple times. Without a defined function, you would have to copy and paste the same code multiple times. In general, you always want to avoid duplicating code because if you ever decide to update the code y0ou’ll have to remember to change the code everywhere you copied it. As you get more programming experience, you’ll often find yourself deduplicating code, which means getting rid of duplicated or copy-and-pasted code. Deduplication makes your programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update.\n",
