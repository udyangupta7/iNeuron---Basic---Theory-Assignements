    "\n",
    "A log level or log severity is a piece of information telling how important a given log message is. It is a simple, yet very powerful way of distinguishing log events from each other. If the log levels are used properly in your application all you need is to look at the severity first. The 5 levels are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. DEBUG – less granular compared to the TRACE level, but it is more than you will need in everyday use. The DEBUG log level should be used for information that may be needed for diagnosing issues and troubleshooting or when running application in the test environment for the purpose of making sure everything is running correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. INFO – the standard log level indicating that something happened, the application entered a certain state, etc. For example, a controller of your authorization API may include an INFO log level with information on which user requested authorization if the authorization was successful or not. The information logged using the INFO log level should be purely informative and not looking into them on a regular basis shouldn’t result in missing any important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. WARN – the log level that indicates that something unexpected happened in the application, a problem, or a situation that might disturb one of the processes. But that doesn’t mean that the application failed. The WARN level should be used in situations that are unexpected, but the code can continue the work. For example, a parsing error occurred that resulted in a certain document not being processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ERROR – the log level that should be used when the application hits an issue preventing one or more functionalities from properly functioning. The ERROR log level can be used when one of the payment systems is not available, but there is still the option to check out the basket in the e-commerce application or when your social media logging option is not working for some reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. FATAL – the log level that tells that the application encountered an event or entered a state in which one of the crucial business functionality is no longer working. A FATAL log level may be used when the application is not able to connect to a crucial data store like a database or all the payment systems are not available and users can’t checkout their baskets in your e-commerce."

    "\n",
    "It provides an overriding logging level for all loggers which takes precedence over the logger's own level. When the need arises to temporarily throttle logging output down across the whole application, this function can be useful. Its effect is to disable all logging calls of severity level and below, so that if you call it with a value of INFO, then all INFO and DEBUG events would be discarded, whereas those of severity WARNING and above would be processed according to the logger's effective level. If logging.disable(logging.NOTSET) is called, it effectively removes this overriding level, so that logging output again depends on the effective levels of individual loggers."

In another function we used disable function to escape or we can say disable up to that logging level messages and also we use levelValue keyword argument and set its value to NOTSET. If we don't pass any value to this function then it will take NOTSET by default. In this function we pass INFO value as an argument, disable function will ignore that level and below that level of messages. We passed INFO as an argument so we can't see INFO, DEBUG level of messages. We can see only above that level of messages like WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL."
